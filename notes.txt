Create, read(retrieve), update, delete(C.R.U.D)

NRDBMS--mongoDB, apache cassandra, firebase etc

queries are requests made to the database management system for specific information

primary key -- basically an attribute which uniquely defines the row in the DB
surrogate key-- basically a key that has no mapping to anything in the real world

natural key--is a key that has a mapping or has a purpose in the real world, not just in the DB

Foreign key--link us to another DB table (a way that we can define relationship B/W the two or more tables

Composite key-- basically a key that needs two attributes Because they both don't have uniquely identify each row
(only together they can uniquely identify it)
we define two columns as the primary key, which would be a composite key

SQL-- is actually a hybrid language, it's basically 4 types of languages in one
Data query language(DQL)
Data Definition language (DDL)
Data Control language(DCL)
Data manipulation language(DML)
